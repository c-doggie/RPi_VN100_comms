# RPi to VN100 IMU Sensor
This is a basic script that enables the Raspberry Pi to communnicate with a Vector Nav VN100 sensor via the Serial UART port. It uses the pyserial library.

Note: this script assume that the VN100 is using the factory configuration of what the sensor outputs by default. It will not work with a custom configuration.
